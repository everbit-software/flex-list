# Flex Lists

Create lists with remote data easily with options for pagination, searching and customising rendering.

## To Do
- [x] Enable/disable search
- [x] Custom renderers: Render the list to your needs with custom renderers, as well as built in ones like the `TableRenderer`
- [x] Pagination
  - [ ] Ability to disable it
- [ ] Custom loaders: By default, the list will use numbers as pages. But this could add the ability to change the 
  behaviour of the list, such as using date ranges. Say each page could show a month, and changing the pages would 
  change the month to fit the data. 
- [x] Themes
  - [x] No framework
  - [x] Bootstrap 5
